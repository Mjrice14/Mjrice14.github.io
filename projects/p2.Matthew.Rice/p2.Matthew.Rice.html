<li style="margin-left: 30px">For this interface I plan to display the users weight for their health information, and it will be moved to the other side.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 30px">There will be a bar around the entire interface that will light up for the advanced feature.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 30px">Overall the goal of this design is to be simple and very easy for the user to quickly get information from it.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 30px">The color design will mainly be black and white with some colors in the weather and on the light bulb itself.</li>

<li style="margin-left: 30px">I implemented my mirror using p5.js because p5.js was much easier to implement the features that I wanted to.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 30px">I decided to remove the border around each section that I had in my sketch and instead had a horizontal line seperate them.</li>
